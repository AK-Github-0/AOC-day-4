# AOC-day-4
Advent of code day 4

This is an easy solution in python for problem 1 and 2 of AOC day 4.

In this solution I used split method to separate the two ranges given in input data and storing them in variables a1,a2 and b1,b2. 

Then I counted all the elements in problem part one using all function and any in problem part two.
